    This release contains a schema migration for the ``nova_api`` database
    in order to address bug 1738094:

    https://bugs.launchpad.net/nova/+bug/1738094

    The migration is optional and can be postponed if you have not been
    affected by the bug. The bug manifests itself through "Data too long for
    column 'spec'" database errors.
